Rug: The Somali National PUDO Network
<!-- This is a placeholder for a future logo -->
Rug (Somali for "courier") is a digital platform designed to build a modern, reliable last-mile delivery network for the Somali Postal Service (SomPost) by creating a de facto national digital addressing system.
üö© The Problem: An Address for Everyone
Somalia faces a unique logistical challenge: the absence of a standardized street addressing system. This makes last-mile delivery inefficient, unreliable, and nearly impossible to scale. For Somali Post, this means lost parcels, high operational costs, and an inability to compete in the growing world of e-commerce and international logistics.
üí° The Solution: Your Phone is Your Address
"Rug" solves this problem by fundamentally changing how deliveries are addressed. Instead of a street address, we use the most ubiquitous identifier in Somalia: the mobile phone number.
The system links every registered user's phone number to a physical, verified Pick-Up Drop-Off (PUDO) point‚Äîa local shop, pharmacy, or post office. This creates a simple, powerful, and scalable network.
The core workflow is simple:
A parcel for "Abdi" arrives in Somalia, addressed with his phone number: +252 612 345678.
SomPost staff look up the number in the "Rug" system.
The system shows Abdi‚Äôs chosen PUDO point: "Juba Hypermarket, Yaaqshiid District."
The parcel is routed to the Juba Hypermarket.
Abdi receives an SMS with a secure pickup code. He collects his parcel at his convenience.
‚ú® Key Features
The "Rug" ecosystem consists of three interconnected components:
üì± 1. The Customer App (for Somali Citizens)
Simple Onboarding: Register in seconds with just a phone number and OTP verification.
PUDO Discovery: Browse an interactive map and list of all verified PUDO points.
Digital Address Linking: Select a convenient PUDO as your official delivery location.
Real-Time Tracking: View the status of all your incoming parcels in one dashboard.
Secure Notifications: Receive instant SMS and push notifications with a unique pickup code when your parcel is ready.
üì¶ 2. The PUDO Employee App (for PUDO Partners)
Fast Parcel Check-In: Scan a parcel's barcode using a phone camera to log its arrival.
Automated Notifications: Checking in a parcel automatically triggers the pickup notification to the customer.
Secure Verification: Verify a customer's identity by entering their unique pickup code.
Offline Capability: A "Store-and-Forward" mechanism ensures the app works even in areas with unstable internet connectivity.
üåê 3. The SomPost Admin Portal (for Management)
Centralized PUDO Management: Approve, manage, and monitor all PUDO locations in the network.
Operational Analytics: A powerful dashboard to track parcel volume, delivery times, and PUDO performance.
User & Parcel Support: Look up user accounts and track parcels to resolve customer issues quickly.
Logistics Planning: Use data to optimize delivery routes and identify areas for network expansion.
üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The platform is designed as a modern, scalable, API-first system.
